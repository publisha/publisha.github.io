# Is this the Final Version?
**Iterative Publishing**

## Abstract

Why do publishing students (or indeed publishers), save their files with such names as *finalversion1*? Of course, it can't be the final version - you just hoped that it would be - didn't you?

Books like other created artefacts go through a number of iterations before being ready for public display. The question is, can we observe and record what those changes are and when they happened, and by whom?

In this article we look at the way that the reader of the book will know what version they are reading and the author / editor will know what version they are editing. We look at this in relation to print, digital and author or editor workflows.

## Introduction

We should start by announcing a couple of quotes.

### Semantic Versioning

First from the organisation known as *semver* - short for Semantic Versioning. The Semantic Versioning[^1] specification is authored by Tom Preston-Werner, inventor of Gravatars and cofounder of GitHub. Here is the quote from Jurgen Van de Moere[^2], who explains semantic versioning better than I can:

> In essence a semantic version looks like this:
> **Major.Minor.Patch**
> So v1.3.8 has a major component with a value of 1, a minor component with a value of 3 and a patch component with a value of 1.

### Apple's Rules for eBook Versions

Apple are very strict when you want to update an eBook on the iBookstoe. Here are the rules from the iBooks Asset Guide[^3]

>In general, the first number of the version number represents a major revision; the second number would be used for a revision containing several changes/new information; the third number would be used to indicate minor changes, such as fixing a typo or formatting issues. For example, if the first version of the book was 1.0, a subsequent minor revision could be 1.0.1; a more substantial revision could be 1.1; a total rewrite could be 2.0.

## Part 1: Public Facing Versions

### In Print

There are a number of conventions that have been used over the years, and some style guides do attempt to keep this under some kind of order.

In _The Chicago Manual of Style_ we do find:

>The publishing history of a book, which usually follows the copyright notice, begins with the date (year) of original publication, followed by the number and date of any new edition. In books with a long publishing history, it is acceptable to present only the original edition and the latest edition in the publishing history.

and

> Impression lines work to the advantage of readers and publishers bothâ€”a new impression not only reflects the sales record of a book but also signals that corrections may have been made.
