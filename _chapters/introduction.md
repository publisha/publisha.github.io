# Introduction
In a previous eBook *eBook Typography* I dealt purely with the standard re-flowable eBook, in which the user can adjust the font size, typeface and other typographic details. In some ways this earlier work was just one detail in the ever increasing complexity and alternative options in creating eBooks. My eBook *From pBook to eBook* gives an overview of the various options open to publishers when they create eBooks as part of the workflow from print production.

In *From pBook to eBook* one option was to create a fixed-layout eBook using Adobe InDesign. An eBook using this method results in an ePub to the ePub3 standard and provides more distribution options than the *multi-touch* eBook that is delivered using Apple's iBooks Author software. This latter was also covered in *From pBook to eBook*, which itself was created with iBooks Author.

**iBooks Author** is a terrific piece of software and really offers a great number of techniques for adding interactivity and dynamic effects, however, eBooks created with this software can only be delivered through Apple or distributed for free. On the other hand, ePub files that conform to the correct standard can be distributed via a variety of systems; as well as through the Apple Store.

Most eBooks should be delivered as re-flowable; fiction and non-fiction trade books tend to be delivered as such. Even when there is a need for illustrations, the widely supported re-flowable ePub is what most eReader software and devices support. There are some differences in the way publishers create these eBooks and it can be frustrating when reading on your Amazon Kindle or your Nook, the way images can be enlarged (or not), or the way footnotes and hyperlinks can disturb the reading flow.

The fixed-layout eBook is essentially the same as the printed page or the PDF. However, there really needs to be a good reason to deliver as fixed-layout, since we are removing certain useful and sometimes essential user control from the reading experience. We can justify the fixed-layout choice, because we want to enhance the reading experience with some features that provide extra information beyond the normal reading flow.

This book describes our choices and strategies and then the workflow that leads through the process towards the final delivery of an eBook that can be tested on a number of devices.

Before we begin, there are some aspects that I need to draw attention to, so that your expectations don't get too high!

- I will be covering all the enhancements that you can add to a fixed-layout eBook but understand that the more you add to an eBook the larger it gets; video will significantly bloat the file and you may find that some ecosystems limit the file size supported (see Google Playbooks).
- Most of the methods explored in this book use Adobe InDesign from the latest Creative Cloud subscription service; if you are using earlier versions of InDesign, you will be disappointed because **only** InDesign version 11 and above can create animation, multi-object frames and incorporate HTML.
- Software never stays still; I will endeavour to continue to release new versions of this book, but what you read here may not be correct if you are using later software or the eBook reader software changes after this book goes public.

Let's get down to it then; I will presume that you will read this book in the sequence that I provide, but if you feel that you already know certain basics then feel free to skip. However, as I tell my students on a publishing masters course, maybe you have learnt some bad habits that you need to unlearn!
