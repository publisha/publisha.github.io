# Chapter 4 - eBook Production with InDesign

## Overview

---

“Things to do:
Turn on hidden characters​
Keep this on to show you where you might have empty paragraphs, double spaces, space at the end of a paragraph/heading, tabs, and soft-breaks.​
Some of these things you might want to be rid of, but some, just may not convert to the ePub (tabs for instance).
Create a root paragraph style for the major part of the content (usually the body text)​
This makes sense if you have a lot of text that needs a style applying. Use select-all and then style with that body text style. The headings can then be styled afterwards.​
You might also consider using 'Next-Style' as a rule for the headings, so that headings are followed by a special first paragraph in the chapter or sub-section.
Make a style (paragraph, character and object) for every category of content that you will have in your publication​
These styles get converted to HTML mark-up in the ePub
Make sure everything is styled with a style definition. If you use bespoke styles (by selecting attributes directly), your ePub may contain hard-to-edit, complex markup.
Give names to your styles that make sense[…]”
