# Introduction

This book describes our choices and strategies and then the workflow that leads through the process towards the final delivery of an eBook that can be delivered on a number of devices.

Before we begin with the Choices chapter, there are some aspects that I need to draw to your attention.

- I will be covering all the enhancements that you can add to a fixed-layout eBook but understand that the more you add to an eBook the larger it gets; video will significantly bloat the file and you may find that some ecosystems limit the file size supported (eg. Google Playbooks).
- Most of the methods explored in this book use Adobe InDesign from the latest Creative Cloud subscription service; if you are using earlier versions of InDesign, you will be disappointed because **only** InDesign version 11 and above can create animation, multi-object frames and incorporate HTML. Earlier versions of InDesign are not very good at creating any type of eBook.
- Software never stays still; I will endeavour to continue to release new versions of the digital book, but what you read here may not be correct if you are using later software or the eBook reader software changes after this book goes public.

Let's get down to it then; I will presume that you will read this book in the sequence that I provide, but if you feel that you already know certain basics then feel free to skip. However, as I tell my students on a publishing masters course, maybe you have learnt some bad habits that you need to unlearn!
