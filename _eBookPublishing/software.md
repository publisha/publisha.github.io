# A review of Useful Software

## InDesign
Although this is expensive, if you are creating print books as well as eBook versions then this is essential. It is important to have a subscription to Creative Cloud because the software is often updated, and many of the recent updates (since InDesign CS6) have been to the functions that export to the ePub formats.

## ePubCheck
It is essential to validate the finished ePub file before distribution. ePubcheck is a java application and can be found here: https://github.com/IDPF/epubcheck

## Sigil
Sigil is an open source ePub creator and editor (https://sigil-ebook.com/about/). It can be used to edit the ePub created by InDesign, but it does make certain changes to the structure of the ePub, that remove the possibility of going back to InDesign for further changes.

## Calibre
Very similar to Sigil (https://calibre-ebook.com) but possibly updated more frequently.

## Postediting
If you do want to edit the ePub after export from InDesign, then a MAC may be the best hardware platform, because the best editor that can edit an ePub without unpacking is BBedit - not free, from http://www.barbones.com

If you do want to unpack and repack (so you can optimise images) then a script is useful for this (MAC again): https://storage.googleapis.com/google-code-archive-downloads/v2/code.google.com/epub-applescripts/ePub%20Zip%20Unzip%202.0.1.app.zip

To optimise images after unpacking then this utility for Apple MACoS: https://imageoptim.com

Once you have unpacked the ePub you can also consider using Adobe Dreamweaver to make changes. This is part of the Adobe Creative Cloud subscription so if you are using InDesign, then you are likely to have this too.
