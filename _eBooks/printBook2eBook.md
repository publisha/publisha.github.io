### Design and Production Techniques Where Both Print Book and eBook Are Required

This eBook uses the example of a Shakespeare Play with introductory text and images as well as some sample multimedia. The sample eBook is built 3 ways; as a Reflowable ePUB, a Fixed-Layout ePUB and a multi-touch eBook using iBooks Author.

**Built with iBooks Author**

> Note: I recently had to change the title and subtitle to conform to title case rules with Apple. Title case rules should conform to those recommended in 'The Chicago Manual of Style'
