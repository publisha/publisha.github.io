# eEditing for multi-channel publishing
**Browser based systems for editing books and output to multiple formats**

**Author:** Chris Jennings

## Introduction
The are are now several systems available that make use of web browsers (Google Chrome, Safari etc)  to provide editing capability.  Maybe we have become used to  tools that provide wysiwyg text inputting for blogging platforms such as blogger.com or wordpress.  I will explore in this article editing systems where the content is actually stored (much like blogging content) on a remote server. 

Authors use word processors to write text. This is a truism. Although there are many word processing programs on the market, Microsoft Word is the most common and although the format is propriety, files can be converted and edited with other tools.  LibreOffice Office is a good alternative to Word and for Apple users there is Pages that can open Word files and export back to the Word format.

However, we want to focus on entirely different approaches and so we should look at another phenomenon that makes use of another way of entering and formatting text. This takes the form of a markup format that is both machine and human readableâ€“ `Markdown`. 

## Structure rather than Style

Since our objective is to provide documents that will eventually, serve multiple formats we want our text to be logically structured.

The problem of word processing software, is that it is too easy to select styling that only visually enhance the text but does not adhere to any structural conformance. A word processed document that looks good, may not lend itself to being the basis for formats such as HTML and ePub. Since we know that web pages and ePub (also formed from HTML) keeping the structure as simple as the basic markup 

### What do I mean by structuring the text?

First of all we have the `blocks` of text; these can be paragraphs, headings, lists or blockquotes. Headings can have different levels that head up divisions and help guide the reader through the sections. The headings need to be nested properly; so a sub heading will follow a top level heading, not the other way around. Paragraphs  are the basic blocks of text and are usually all of the same, although we might define a different type of paragraph that follows a heading. Blockquotes are paragraphs that may be set differently; drawing attention to themselves.

Within the blocks of text we will sometimes need to draw a different emphasise with words in bold or italic. These inline elements will be `children` of their paragraphs. Although I refer here to **bold** and *italic* we should not concern ourselves with appearance or style, because this can be anything we like and applied later in the workflow to publish. 

The important thing is the structure and because of this, we can utilise an editing system that is very simple; `Markdown` .

## Markdown writing tools

Some authors are using such tools as *Ulysses* or *Scrivener* to write their texts. At the heart of these tools is a standard way to structure (we come to styling later) the text. 

I am using Markdown to write this text. Markdown simply uses hash codes  to indicate levels of heading. One hash is the top level # with ## and ### and so on being the following levels 2 and 3. A basic paragraph needs no markup particularly but does need to be separated with a break (2 returns will ensure this is separated).

Lists (bulleted or numbered) have special methods. A bulleted list is created by adding a `+` sign and space before the first item; thereafter a single break will continue the list. Numbered lists are similar but a number 1. a period and space will start the list.

Blockquotes  need a `>` at the start of the first line.

Inline elements can use either an asterix `*` or an underscore `_`.

If you need to display a block of code in a technical document, then a set of 3 backticks will start the and finish the block.

Here is an example of how this appears:

```markdown
# This is a heading
## This is a sub heading

A paragraph of text looks like this and simply continues **although** can have **bold** and *italic* text.

+ One
+ Two
+ Buckle my shoe

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3

> Mary had a little lamb
> Its fleece was white as snow

```

There are other codes that will be needed for embedding images or for making hyperlinks. Footnotes are also possible, but as you will see, there are apps and tools that make this much easier.

## Tools that make this easy

I am writing this on my iPad with an app called **Editorial**. I am expected to type the markdown codes but the app makes this easy by providing a set of buttons along the bottom of the screen. The text will also be displayed appropriately giving feedback and confirmation that the elements are correctly formed.

I show here an example of _Editorial_ in use.

There are other apps,  that use markdown for both iOS and desktop computers.

### Conversion to other formats

To publish our documents or to deliver to those that need proprietary formats (such as Microsoft Word), we will need to convert or export the texts.

Some apps will already include the ability to directly export to a variety of formats; Ulysses, for example, will export to `docx`, `PDF` and `ePub` as well as `HTML`.

**Markdown** is raw text and has no styling applied. It can be read by any human or interpreted by a computer program that will then tag the markup and make appropriate formatting conversions depending on the requirement of the target file type.

### Pandoc

Thanks to John Macfarlane, a Professor of Philosophy at the University of California, we can convert just about any document format to any other with this universal document converter.

Pandoc can be used in a `command line` mode. Here is an example that will convert a Word file to a Markdown document:

$ pandoc --wrap=none --extract-media=images somefile.docx
 -o mynewfile.md
 
 Since **Pandoc** can be utilised on a web server, it can also be used by online tools to form publishing options.  
 
 Let us now explore some online systems that can provide multi-format export after editing in the browser.  Many of these systems also provide collaborative editing. 

## Working Files in the Cloud

In an article I wrote recently about version control, (link here)  I mentioned a few systems for collaborative editing and a significant development elaborated there was the use of `Git` as a repository for files. Here is not the place to go into details about Git, but the system offers great potential for editing and exporting documents in a variety of formats.

### Penflip

I have used this system with my students to edit a guidebook to Oxford for new students. You can see in the image here, that we are able to export the content into a number of formats; in this image, I show how we take the exported files and convert to `ICML` for input to InDesign.

Penflip works well, but I cannot recommend it for serious work, since the support has fallen off, and may not be developed further.
