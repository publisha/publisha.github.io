# Footnotes and Other Diversions
**How do footnotes, endnotes, margin notes and other deviations from the narrative flow, work in a screen based medium?**

**Author:** Chris Jennings

## Abstract
Footnotes are marvellous things. They can provide extra information that helps to elaborate or to cite sources. Publishers don’t like footnotes;  they prefer endnotes, because they are far easier to manage. But endnotes become a burden for reader who need to memorise the reference number, page number and even the chapter number before heading off to the back of the book to track down the elusive note.

Footnotes are an endangered species. With the coming of the 21st century, the hyperlink was thought to solve many of these conundrums. They don’t. But should we now encourage authors to make use of the interactive note in the eBook? What can the new popup note and the scrolling excursus add to an author’s work?

When Edward Gibbons published his 6 volume *The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire* towards the end of the 18th Century, he included almost  8,000 footnotes.
