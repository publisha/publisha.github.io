# Footnotes and Other Diversions
**How do footnotes, endnotes, margin notes and other deviations from the narrative flow, work in a screen based medium?**

**Author:** Chris Jennings

## Abstract
When Edward Gibbon published his 6 volume *The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire* towards the end of the 18th Century, he included almost  8,000 footnotes. He wasn’t the first to incorporate supplementary information but  Gibbon’s work established the standard for academic publications.

Footnotes are marvellous things. They can provide extra information that helps to elaborate or to cite sources. Publishers don’t like footnotes;  they prefer endnotes, because they are far easier to manage. But endnotes become a burden for reader who need to memorise the reference number, page number and even the chapter number before heading off to the back of the book to track down the elusive note.

Footnotes are an endangered species. With the coming of the 21st century, the hyperlink was thought to solve many of these conundrums. They don’t. But  what about the eBook. Can authors be creative with the interactive note in the eBook? What can the  popup note and the scrolling *excursus* add to an author’s work?

## Introduction
This paper sets out to explore the relationship between the footnote in the printed work and the equivalent mechanism in screen based medium.

What are the conventions in print publishing to display footnotes, side notes and other forms of deviations from the narrative flow? We will look at some examples of the way information is cross linked and where this information is  typically displayed in the printed work.
