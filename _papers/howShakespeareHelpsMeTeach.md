# How Shakespeare Helps me Teach Multi-Platform Publishing
**Using public domain texts and other resources**

**Author:** Chris Jennings

## Abstract
Masters students in the Oxford International Centre for Publishing  (OICP) at Oxford Brookes University get a chance to design and produce a book of one of Shakespeare’s plays and then further develop this as a web site and various eBook  formats.

Using Shakespeare’s plays (content in the public domain) helps me, as the tutor for these students,  provide all the experience necessary to build wonderful publishable artefacts. They can choose any of Shakespeare’s plays apart from A Midsummer Night’s Dream; this is the play that I use to demonstrate the various assignments.

## Introduction
I have been teaching digital publishing at Oxford Brookes University since 1995, and, un-surprisingly, I have needed to change focus and digital tools many times. From CD-ROM to web, from Macromedia Director to InDesign— you know what I mean. We talked of SGML and Aldus Pagemaker, now we talk of POD (Print On Demand), ePub and XML.

Anyway, we are always re-inventing what we believe the students need to know.  My students are studying on an  MA Publishing programme and expect to move into the publishing industry. We listen to our `Industry Advisory Board` when they say that their new recruits need more knowledge of  digital technologies.

## Content is King (Lear)

We have to work with something. We can’t expect our students to actually create the content (this is not what publishers do). And, in any case, we can’t wait for that to happen; we need something to work with that is available but is also challenging. We need content that can be enhanced with images and even multi-media.

### The Play’s the thing[^1]

The typographic choices when setting a play are really quite interesting, and although there are conventions[^2] we still have a lot of flexibility.  A play includes many different elements which  all need to be styled appropriately. Moreover, there is a need to provide a structure to the form that helps the reader work through the flow of the text.

### The structure of a play

Let’s go through the details of a Shakespeare play and consider the structure.

There will be some prelims such as the title page but thereafter we will need:

#### Dramatis Personae

This is where the characters are listed. This is often presented as a list with the character name followed by their role. We are likely to consider the whole line as one entity and then the `role` inside this. It could be presented as a table. The facsimile (from where the public domain text has come from) may use `ditto` where the role is repeated. [we can look at examples]

The last line of the Dramatis Personae will announce the general location of the play.

#### The Play

The structure may be simply several scenes inside an Act. Possibly 5 Acts with 3 or 4 scenes in each. Some plays have a prologue and even an epilogue. [check the range of structures]

The **Act** is the top level in the play structure. The title of this may be simply at the top of the first page or may even have a page (recto in print) dedicate to it. The number could be uppercase roman, Arabic or even a word. So we might depict as:

> Act IV, Act 4 or Act Four

The latter being most unusual.

The **Scenes**, likewise may be as:

> Scene III, Scene 3 or Scene Three

The conventions dictate the first of these in each case, but we are looking at the possible options and encourage new choices.

Each scene label is normally followed by a **location** for that scene.

Now follows the first **stage direction**.

### To be or not to Be

The words spoken in the play will be preceded by the name of the character and the method of displaying this is our first  structure and presentation conundrum.

To explain the issue we should look at how the character name is presented in print versions of the play, and we might look first at a page from the `first folio` of Shakespeare’s works. The image below shows the opening page of a _Midsummer Night’s Dream_

You will notice that the character name is abbreviated. We don’t want our modern version to emulate this. Some public domain texts (from which we work) also abbreviate the character name. We will need to use `search/replace` to
change these. While we are here, we should observe also that the abbreviated character name is *on the same line* as the first line of the speech. More on this in a moment.

In the image below is a modern version of *A Midsummer Nights’s Dream*.

We are most likely to be working from a public domain text that has been scanned from print

I'll have grounds
More relative than this—the play's the thing
Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the King
