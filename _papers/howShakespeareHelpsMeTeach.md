# How Shakespeare Helps me Teach Multi-Platform Publishing
**Using public domain texts and other resources**

**Author:** Chris Jennings

## Abstract
Masters students in the Oxford International Centre for Publishing Studies (OICPS) at Oxford Brookes University get a chance to design and produce a book of one of Shakespeare’s plays and then further develop this as a web site and various eBook  formats.

Using Shakespeare’s plays (content in the public domain) helps me, as the tutor for these students,  provide all the experience necessary to build wonderful publishable artefacts.

## Introduction
I have been teaching digital publishing at Oxford Brookes University since 1995, and, un-surprisingly, I have needed to change focus and digital tools many times. From CD-ROM to web, from Macromedia Director to InDesign— you know what I mean. We talked of SGML and Aldus Pagemaker, now we talk of POD (print on Demand), ePub and XML.

Anyway, we are always re-inventing what we believe the students need to know.  My students are studying on an  MA Publishing programme and expect to move into the publishing industry. We listen to our `Industry Advisory Board` when they say that their new recruits need more knowledge of  digital technologies.

## Content is King (Lear)

We have to work with something. We can’t expect our students to actually create the content (this is not what publishers do). And, in any case, we can’t wait for that to happen; we need something to work with that is available but also challenging. We need content that can be enhanced with images and even multi-media.

### The Play’s the thing[^2]

The typographic choices when setting a play are really quite interesting, and although there are conventions[^1] we still have a lot of flexibility.  A play includes many different elements which  all need to be styled appropriately. Moreover, there is a need to provide a structure to the form that helps the reader work through the flow of the text.

I'll have grounds
More relative than this—the play's the thing
Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the King
