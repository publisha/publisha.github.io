We're creating an eBook in InDesign. We're not planning a print book at all - just straight to an eBook; what size page should we choose?

## Why should you care?

When we create an eBook (reflowable) users get to change the font size. This is how it is in all eReader devices although the range of sizes varies considerably.

Let's use the iPad with Apple's iOS as an example. Let's have a look at iBooks (the standard app on the iPad for viewing eBooks).

## iBooks

On any MAC with iBooks, a reflowable eBook provides the user with font size 'adjuster' symbolised as a small and large capital `A`. You can see the image alongside here.

The range of choices is extreme: There are 11 steps from when the little `A` is greyed out to when the large `A` is greyed out. As you see from the nest image here, the large size is - well, kind of ridiculous.

### The target size for the body text font?

Whatever you think you want, you may not get it! The problem is that the reader may have adjusted the font size when they read another book before yours, so you don't know what they will see at first.
