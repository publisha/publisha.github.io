So you have used InDesign to create a wonderful printed book of a Shakespeare play, and you chose a standard page size (my example is: 206mm x138mm). Now when you make the eBook from the spreads, you get a white line down the middle or, on bleeding images, there might be a little gap at the bottom of the page.

See the first image here to understand what I mean.
