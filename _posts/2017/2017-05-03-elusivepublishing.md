Oh the time spent without result!

I know I am not alone in this. I am trying to find a solution to the following:

* Host documents in GitHub (or some other repository that handles versioning)
* Edit these documents using markdown.
* Have multiple editors with different levels of approval and status
* Show edits and status
* Alert primary editor of requested changes
* Export to a number of formats including raw and `ICML` for InDesign

## What is out there now?

**Here is what I have been using**

### Penflip
I am starting with Penflip because this has solved a problem for me in teaching a class in Digital Workflow. The only issue with this solution is that it *may* not be sustainable since the online tool does not appear to have much support. Maybe I should not be so negative, but there is a risk in using  a system that could stop at any time. Having said that, it does simplify the workflow. We saw what happened to Editorially.
