We should all be very grateful that Flickr exists. This is one of the most popular (free if you want) hosting services that is also very sophisticated in the way that it delivers, and categorises images. But there is more; Flickr has an **API** that enables you yo pull your hosted pictures down to your own web site. I am doing this here (see the rolling banner on the home page and the galleries).

## What got me started

I have a book in my shelf. It is quite old now. It's called *Flickr Hacks* 2006, O'Reilly Publishers, New York.

This book is an unusual O'Reilly book, in that it does not have an engraving of an animal but rather the slide projector. As you can see, it's a Kodak Carousel.
