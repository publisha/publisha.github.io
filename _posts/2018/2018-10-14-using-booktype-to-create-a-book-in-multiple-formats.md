Booktype is web based, single-source publishing software for creating  books. The software is open-source so you can (expertise needed) install on your own server and create and edit books and then, export to a number of formats.

[More information on the Booktype page][7c7006d7].

## Here is what I have done

I have installed Booktype (with a lot of assistance) on a Debian 9 server and we (my students and I) are editing a book together. The book is *A Student Guide to Oxford*. I can't show you this book at the moment, because this is set up as a private book. However, you can see Booktype in action with this animated GIF alongside here (click to enlarge).

I am using Booktype as part of my research into sharable editing systems and 2 of my articles here are referring to Booktype as one of a number of
tools that can be used by editors.

[Iterative Publishing][ce062769] mentions Booktype in reference to collaborative editing.

[eEditing for multi-channel publishing][236844fa] was also used as the basis for a presentation at the Society for Editors and Proofreaders (SfEP) conference.

## A Booktype instance

The Booktype instance is installed on my site - booktype.publisha.org ut you can also try the software out for your self on the [omnibook.pro site][13805a03] where there is a public version.

## Export to a number of formats?

This is the brilliant feature that you will love; you can export your efforts out to a number of formats including ePub, MOBI and ICML (for import to InDesign and iBooks Author).
