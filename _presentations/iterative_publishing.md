## Is this the Final Version?

Why do publishing students (or indeed publishers), save their files with such names as *finalversion1*?

Of course, we all know that it can't be the final version - they just hoped that it would be!

Books like other created artefacts go through a number of iterations before being ready for public display. The question is, can we observe and record what those changes are and when they happened, and by whom?

In this presentation we look at the way that the reader of the book will know what version they are reading and the author / editor will know what version they are editing. We look at this in relation to print, digital and author or editor workflows.

This presentation was given at the _By the Book - 4_ conference in Florence, June 2017.
