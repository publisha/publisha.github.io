This is a 2 part screencast

iBooks Author provides some ways to get content from InDesign. The best way is to export from InDesign to the IDML format but we need to do this section by section.

This first screencast episode shows you how to divide the InDesign file into separated files using a couple of scripts.

## Further Information

The 2 InDesign scripts used are:

**splitbeforehere** (this is based on a script called StorySplitter with modifications by Naomi Kennedy and then myself)

**extractpagesandIDML** (this is based on a script by Lo√Øc Aigon, much simplified with additional components to export IDML)

These 2 scripts are available as Gists and the links Ito then can [be found on this page](https://publisha.github.io/pages/iBooksAuthor/ "From InDesign to iBooks Author").
