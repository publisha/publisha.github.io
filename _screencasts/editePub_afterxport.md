Once we have exported the reflow-able ePub from InDesign, we can make changes by editing the CSS that InDesign has created. WE want to achieve a *roundtrip* workflow, allowing us the potential to go back to InDesign and re-export. To achieve this we must make our own version of the CSS, that will override those generated by InDesign.

The CSS file that we create can be loaded into the ePub when we export the reflow-able ePub. This screencast shows some examples of style that might need to be changed by editing the CSS.
