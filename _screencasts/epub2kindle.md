Our eBook production workflow involves perfecting for the ePub3 format first by exporting from InDesign and then making minimal adjustments through our own CSS file. Once we have everything ready to go, we can then convert this ePub to the MOBI file for the Amazon Kindle.

We may learn that there are some shortcomings and we may still need to return to the ePub for some adjustments before (once again) using a conversion tool.

Amazon make available the tools for the [conversion on the web site here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&docId=1000765261 "Kindle Previewer").
