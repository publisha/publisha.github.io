**This is a Multi part screencast**

In this first part of multiple screencasts in a Youtube Playlist. In this episode I will show you the finished (actually a work in progress) so you can see what kind of features we can add to this version of the eBook.

- What happens to our double page spreads?
- What shall we do with the half-title page?
- How can we deliver a fixed landscape view?
