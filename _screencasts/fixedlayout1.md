**This is a 3 part screencast**

In this first part of the 3 screencasts we look at the basic issues when creating a Fixed-layout ePub3 from an InDesign book that is already set up for print.

- What happens to our double page spreads?
- What shall we do with the half-title page?
- How can we deliver a fixed landscape view?
