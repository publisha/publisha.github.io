**This is a 3 part screencast (please view parts 1 and 2 first)**

For this episode we look at adding multimedia but give the users some control over the playing of that media rather than just have it play on page load.

We also look at creating a simple pair of buttons that will play and pause the audio.

Further on we get a video and show how we can present this on the page.
