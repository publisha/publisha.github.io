**This is a Multi-part screencast (please view parts 1 and 2 first)**

For this episode we go back to our original InDesign file that we used for the print book and the re-flowable eBook. Our job now is to reorganise the pages so that they are built to combine single pages to landscape from the spread.

We also get to see the first instance of some animation with a page transition.
