**This is a Multi-part screencast**

In this second episode we add an image and another page to the ePub and we explore using a couple of useful tools:

Unpacking and repacking the ePub with [eCan Crusher](http//:www/publisha.org/resources/eCanCrusherMac.1.2-2.1.zip)
Checking the validation of the ePub with Pagina's [ePub Checker](https://www.pagina.gmbh/produkte/epub-checker/)

We also look at using Apple Proofer tool within the Apple Books app.

We use the code editor Atom to add XHTML pages and then add to manifest in content.opf package file.

You are welcome to use this template to begin building your own fixed-layout ePub. [Download this ePub file](http://www/publisha.org/resources/templatefixed.epub), unpack with eCan Crusher and then you can edit the components with Atom.
