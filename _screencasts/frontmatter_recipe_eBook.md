We are using an InDesign book to build a recipe eBook. We have added our recipes, now we need the _front matter_ pages. We will also need an introduction to our book; this will come after the table of contents.

But do we need to show the table of contents on the page?

Since this is a reflowable eBook, we need to pay special attention to the way the title page and copyright information is displayed.
