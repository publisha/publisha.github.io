This screencasts explains how to install Atom from an instance that I provide. Although **Atom** is free to download, I have installed all of the various packages to help write blog posts with `markdown`.

[The link for the software is here][50dde787].

  [50dde787]: http://www.publisha.org/resources/atom.zip "This will download a ZIP file for you to unpack."

This screencast explains where to out the various files, and is particular to enable installing where you don't have admin rights.

The installation instructions are for a MAC, but if you want to install on a Windows PC, you can download the application yourself from atom.io and then install the following packages:

- color-picker
- emmet
- markdown-writer
- pandoc-converter
- tool-bar
- tool-bar-markdown-writer

PC users can download a ready made [version from here][96e0bc23].
