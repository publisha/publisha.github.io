We can generate good quality, sensible HTML markup from InDesign so long as we make some adjustments to the way the HTML tags are mapped from our styles.

We can also build an interactive table of contents that gives us a navigation block at the top of the web page.

In this screencast we use the Articles panel to select the components for the HTML.
