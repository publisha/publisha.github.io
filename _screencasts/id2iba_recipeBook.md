When we use iBooks Author, it is essential to consider the structure of our content.

iBooks Author has (potentially) 2 structural levels; the `Chapter` and –within this– the `Section`. We do not need to use both of these and, indeed, we do not need to refer to them with these terms.

We have seen with the creation of the Shakespeare play book, that we have the Act and then the Scene within this. For that project, the Act become the iBooks Author chapter and the Scene become the Section.

### Let us consider the recipe book.

In my example, I simply have one recipe for each Chapter, and so I will use a template that only needs the Chapter (recipe) title page and then further pages for the recipe details and pictures etc.

If your recipe book needs another level, then use a template that needs the Section pages also. A good example of this, would be a recipe book that has meals for Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner.

Breakfast  |  Lunch |  Dinner
--|---|--
Fried Eggs and Bacon  | Tomato Salad  |  Seared Tuna and Potato Salad
Porridge  | Fishcakes  |  Lamb Burgers and Sweet Potato Fries
Muesli  | Omelette  |  Chicken Risotto with Asparagus
