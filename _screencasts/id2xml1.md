With a Shakespeare play in mind we have a DTD that we can import into InDesign. This provides us with the TAGS. If we name our styles with those same tags, we can 'map the styles to the tags' very easily.

Unfortunately, InDesign does not provide us with the automation to map object styles, so we need to add those in to the structure.
