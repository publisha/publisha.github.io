In our InDesign document all content needs to be attached to an appropriate style element.

We can use:
- paragraph styles
- character styles
- object styles
- table styles

We then need tags that will be mapped to those elements. They can (optionally) be the same names as our InDesign styles. They may also come from a DTD uploaded to our InDesign file in the structure pane.
