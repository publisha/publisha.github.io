We look at our Shakespeare play (A Midsummer Night's Dream), built with iBooks Author and proofed on the iPad and iBooks on the MAC.

This is a partially complete work, but gives us an opportunity to show the structure and modes of viewing the eBook. This screencast serves as an introduction to iBooks Author, the free software from Apple. The next episode shows how the Shakespeare play appears in the authoring environment, before we then explore how to build a template for a Shakespeare play.

Please note that since this Screencast iBooks Author no longer refers to a _Portrait View_, but rather a _scrolling view_ which can be invoked in either landscape or portrait view on the iPad with iBooks.
