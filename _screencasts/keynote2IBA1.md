We can enhance the eBook created with iBooks Author in several ways, but here follows a screencast that shows how to add a simple page-turning Keynote presentation into iBooks Author.

The Keynote is built-in to Apple iBooks Author, but in fact one you have created and saved the Keynote (it becomes a file with `.key` extension), you can drag and drop onto the iBooks Author page.

> The images in the Keynote presentation come from the [Folger picture library][45e21c7d] and are provided here for purely educational purposes.
