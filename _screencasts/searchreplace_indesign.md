### Using GREP and a Script
We have our play (A Midsummer Night's Dream) placed in InDesign, but we have some changes we want to make to the text.

We don't want the character names on the same line as the first line of their speech.

We don't want the character names all in uppercase letters.

This screen cast shows some useful ways to use GREP in the Find/Change dialogue and then how to make use of a script to change to title case.
