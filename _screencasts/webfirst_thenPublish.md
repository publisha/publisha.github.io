This screencast demonstrates a web-first publishing system. It uses a web interface to provide an editing environment which, when ready for page layout publishing ready, can be exported to XML.

 The XML can then be imported into a ready prepared InDesign template.

This screencast demonstrates the building of an international recipe book with contributions from various editors.

The final objective in this project was to create an eBook, but this system is equally appropriate for a print version.
