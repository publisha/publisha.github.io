InDesign is a *page layout* tool; presuming for the printed page, but we can still generate HTML from our content and with some attention to detail, we can can get good HTML markup ready for further styling and attention to a responsive design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;details&quot;&gt;This document last edited on: 15 January 2020&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;article class=&quot;snippet&quot;&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/pages/id2iba_recipes/&quot; title=&quot;read this document&quot;&gt;InDesign to iBooks Author (Recipes edition) &lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-caret-right&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Authoring tool for an *Apple-only* hybrid format eBook. iBooks Author is Apple software for creating _Multi-Touch_ eBooks.

                          Footnotes, Endnotes, Sidenotes and Popup Notes These need to be separated from the main body of the text, and are best set with a smaller size and possibly event a different typeface and colour.

                      When we export our book to the reflowable ePub from InDesign, we have a choice about the content order. Usually we choose ‘Based on Page Layout’, but if you want to make sure that your front matter pages don’t end up at the back of the book, then you need to use the Articles Panel to organise the content.

                      Sometimes we want to give editors some editing capabilities after the text has been placed into InDesign. To do this we need to maintain a link between the Word file (.docx) and the InDesign document.

                      How to Create Running Headers 
                      In book design there is often a requirement for headers on the page; that is text that is displayed in the margin that describes the title and often the author of the book. This text may be displayed in the top or bottom margin. Further into the book pages we may want running headers. These are dynamically generated items that change according to where we are in the book. How do we generate these running headers?

                      Editing inside the ePub Package 
                      Once we have exported the reflow-able ePub from InDesign, we can make changes by editing the CSS that InDesign has created. We want to achieve a roundtrip workflow, allowing us the potential to go back to InDesign and re-export. To achieve this we must make our own version of the CSS, that will override those generated by InDesign.

                      Our eBook production workflow involves perfecting for the ePub3 format first by exporting from InDesign and then making minimal adjustments through our own CSS file. Once we have everything ready to go, we can then convert this ePub to the MOBI file for the Amazon Kindle.

                      The baseline in typography is the imaginary line on which most letters sit. The descenders of letters will extend below this line. Also, the body of some letters such as the J and Q in some typefaces will also extend slightly below this baseline.

                          Footnotes, Endnotes, Sidenotes and Popup Notes These need to be separated from the main body of the text, and are best set with a smaller size and possibly event a different typeface and colour. The idea of any notes is that it is supplementary information and it is entirely optional that the reader even bothers to look, so setting in a style that does not distract from the flow of the reading experience is important.This document last edited on:

                      Make a Blog web site with Github Pages 
                      I provide you with a template that you can as the basis of your web site. You’ll need to use some software. Post and pages are created with markdown.

                      Linking a document for editing workflow 
                      Sometimes we want to give editors some editing capabilities after the text has been placed into InDesign. To do this we need to maintain a link between the Word file (.docx) and the InDesign document.

                      InDesign to ePub Reflowable 
                      We take an existing InDesign document prepared for print and export to ePub. We then make some adjustments and do that again.

                      InDesign to HTML 
                      We can generate good quality, sensible HTML(5) markup from InDesign so long as we make some adjustments to the way the HTML tags are mapped from our styles.

                      How to Create Running Headers 
                      In book design there is often a requirement for headers on the page; that is text that is displayed in the margin that describes the title and often the author of the book. This text may be displayed in the top or bottom margin. Further into the book pages we may want running headers. These are dynamically generated items that change according to where we are in the book. How do we generate these running headers?

                      From Footnotes to Popup Notes in Fixed Layout eBook 
                      Although the ePub3 format can support popup notes, it is difficult to achieve this in the fixed-layout version from InDesign.

                      Editing inside the ePub Package 
                      Once we have exported the reflow-able ePub from InDesign, we can make changes by editing the CSS that InDesign has created. We want to achieve a roundtrip workflow, allowing us the potential to go back to InDesign and re-export. To achieve this we must make our own version of the CSS, that will override those generated by InDesign.

                      Converting the reflowable ePub to a Kindle Version 
                      Our eBook production workflow involves perfecting for the ePub3 format first by exporting from InDesign and then making minimal adjustments through our own CSS file. Once we have everything ready to go, we can then convert this ePub to the MOBI file for the Amazon Kindle.

                      Alignment of the Body Text across the spread 
                      The baseline in typography is the imaginary line on which most letters sit. The descenders of letters will extend below this line. Also, the body of some letters such as the J and Q in some typefaces will also extend slightly below this baseline.

                      We are using an InDesign book to build a recipe eBook. We have added our recipes, now we need the front matter pages. We will also need an introduction to our book; this will come after the table of contents.

                      <p>When we export our book to the reflowable ePub from InDesign, we have a choice about the content order. Usually we choose ‘Based on Page Layout’, but if you want to make sure that your front matter pages don’t end up at the back of the book, then you need to use the <em>Articles</em> Panel to organise the content.</p>

                      <p>In book design there is often a requirement for headers on the page; that is text that is displayed in the margin that describes the title and often the author of the book. This text may be displayed in the top or bottom margin. Further into the book pages we may want <em>running headers</em>. These are dynamically generated items that change according to where we are in the book. How do we generate these running headers?</p>

                      <p>Once we have exported the reflow-able ePub from InDesign, we can make changes by editing the CSS that InDesign has created. We want to achieve a <em>roundtrip</em> workflow, allowing us the potential to go back to InDesign and re-export. To achieve this we must make our own version of the CSS, that will override those generated by InDesign.</p>
