# What is this website about?

Chris Jennings teaches Undergraduate and Postgraduate modules on Digital Publishing at Oxford Brookes University. He also is a consultant specialising in eBook production.

Right now a lot of my documents are to found on my [PagetoScreen][b016960a] web site. I also have created lots of PDFs for my students and often printed these out (sometime 70 copies!).

Now it is time (surely) to make all of these helpful documents digital and online, so I can update very easily.

[b016960a]: http://www.pagetoscreen.net "Lots of useful information"

You will [find here help documents and tutorials][182881a3] and a range of topics including using Adobe InDesign and Apple iBooks Author, as well as using GitHub to edit documents within a repository.

  [182881a3]: /contents "See all contents in a menu"

More documents are being added and you can find the list within the left hand menu. Just click on the icon top left or [see the contents page][d78d4ed1].

  [d78d4ed1]: /contents "Open the contents page"

## How was this Web site built?

### Jekyll
The site is built with Jekyll which you can [find out about here][92c344c3]{:target="_blank"}.

It is delivered on a **GitHub** repository with GitHub pages. My preferred writing tool is Atom 'cos you can customise it! I also use *Editorial* on my iPad.

[92c344c3]: https://jekyllrb.com "Visit the Jekyll web site"

### Atom
Atom is the free text editor that comes from GitHub. [You can get it here][f9a83765]{:target="_blank"}.

[f9a83765]: https://atom.io "Get Atom"

[![Here is Atom in use to edit a markdown page with a preview on the right](/images/atominuse.png)](/images/atominuse.png)

### Workflow

If you are lucky enough to own an iPad, then here is a description of my workflow to edit this web site and write a book etc:

On the desktop / laptop I edit text and add images with Atom. Atom needs various packages added in such as *Git Plus*, *Markdown Writer*, *markdown TOC* and a few more. [Read about my use of Atom in the blog article][2ac1fae1].

  [2ac1fae1]: https://publisha.github.io/markdown/2017/03/03/writing-with-atom/ "Open up the blog post"

If working on the iPad then I use *Working Copy* to get the assets from the GitHub repository. This is a [fantastic app][eaf957b6] from Anders Borum. You can't do without it if you want to use GitHub repos from your mobile device.

  [eaf957b6]: https://workingcopyapp.com "This is an iOS Apple app"

[![Working Copy allows you to connect to your GitHub respository](/images/workingcopy.jpg)](/images/workingcopy.jpg)

Once you have your repo mirrored on your iPad then you need to edit the content. I have tried a variety of tools which I won't mention but, in the end the best (IMHO) is *Editorial* from Ole Zorn. This iOS app is a first class markdown editor, but can be extended through Python scripts. [Take a look at the web site for a full description](http://omz-software.com/editorial/).

[![Anything in 'Working Copy' can be edited in 'Editorial', an app on the iPad.](/images/editorial.jpg)](/images/editorial.jpg)

### Design of the site

I based this look and feel on the [Lanyon theme from here][2b9a33ee]{:target="_blank"}.

Images can be enlarged and use a variation of [Fancybox][f6b39499]{:target="_blank"} using jquery.

[f6b39499]: http://fancybox.net "Take a look at Fancybox"

Footnotes are turned into popup notes[^1] using 'Bigfoot' jquery. You can [find out about this here][736ed6d1].
