# Publisha Helper

Right now a lot of my documents are to found on my [PagetoScreen][b016960a] web site. I also have created lots of PDFs for my students and often printed these out (sometime 70 copies!).

Now it is time (surely) to make all of these helpful documents digiatl and online, so I can update very easily.

## Built with Jekyll and Edited with Atom

This site is built with jekyll and delivered on a GitHub repository. My preferred writing tool is Atom 'cos you can customise it!

I based this look and feel on the [Lanyon theme from here][2b9a33ee].
