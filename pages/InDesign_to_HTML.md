  blurb: XML is eXtensible Markup Language and is a non-proprietary markup language that can be used as a future-proof way to store content. XML indicates structure rather than style; in fact XML includes no information about appearance, only structure, hierarchy and element taxonomy.

When we export InDesign to ePub, content is marked-up as HTML and styles are converted to CSS. We can also export to HTML and same thing happens, but what should we do to make sure our HTML and CSS are perfectly formed and can also (if needed) be edited.

## From Styles to Markup

Of course we have developed good habits and have made sure that all content has styles attached. we avoid overrides and adjusting appearance with bespoke settings. We also avoid adding empty paragraphs to achieve space. Once we have our styles applied (paragraph, character and objects) we then need to instruct InDesign what HTML tags to apply to those elements on export.

## HTML and CSS

Styles are applied to HTML Elements
with CSS rules

## InDesign Styles

- Paragraph styles
- Character Styles
- Object Styles
