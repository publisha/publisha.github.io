# What is this website about?

You will find here help documents and tutorials (written by @pageboy) [^2] on a range of topics including using Adobe InDesign and Apple iBooks Author, as well as using GitHub to edit documents within a repository.

More documents are being added and you can find the list within the left hand menu. Just click on the icon top left or [see the contents page][d78d4ed1].

## How was this web site built?

### Jekyll

The site is built with Jekyll which you can [find out about here][92c344c3]{:target="_blank"}.

It is delivered on a **GitHub** repository with GitHub pages. My preferred writing tool is Atom 'cos you can customise it! I also use *Editorial* on my iPad.

> Note: I now tend to use vscode rather than Atom.

### Workflow

If you are lucky enough to own an iPad, then here is a description of my workflow to edit this web site and write a book etc:

On the desktop / laptop I edit text and add images with ~~Atom~~ VSCode. 

If working on the iPad then I use *Working Copy* to get the assets from the GitHub repository. This is a [fantastic app][eaf957b6] from Anders Borum. You can't do without it if you want to use GitHub repos from your mobile device.


Once you have your repo mirrored on your iPad then you need to edit the content. I have tried a variety of tools which I won't mention but, in the end the best (IMHO) is *Editorial* from Ole Zorn. This iOS app is a first class markdown editor, but can be extended through Python scripts. [Take a look at the web site for a full description](http://omz-software.com/editorial/).

### Using Flickr Images

In order to get image from Flickr in the gallery section, I have borrows from [Phil Cohen&#39;s jquery plugin from here](http://phlippers.net/fancy-photoset/).

### Design of the site

I based this look and feel on the [Lanyon theme from here][2b9a33ee]{:target="_blank"}.

Images can be enlarged and use a variation of [Fancybox][f6b39499]{:target="_blank"} using jquery.

Footnotes are turned into popup notes[^1] using 'Bigfoot' jquery. You can [find out about this here][736ed6d1].

The reading position indicator (see the green bar at the top of the page) is a modification of the code from Pankaj Parashar's version at [CodePen][3ba77385].
